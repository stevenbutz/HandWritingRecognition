# B351-Final-Project
Handwriting recognition program using PyTorch

This is our Final project for Intro to AI. We will be using PyTorch to train 
our model, and compare algorithms.

Our program requires tkinter,PIL, torchvision, torch, matplotlib.pyplot
These libraries can be installed using pip3, or however you get your python modules

To run the program, call 'python3 Main.py' in the root directory.

Main.py: Main file used to run the project
Metric_Calculations.py: Used to calculate metrics for the networks
Testing_Sample_Classification_Demo.py: Contains code for sample classification demo of the testing data. press enter to see more images.
feedforeward.py: contains the feed foreward network algorith and the training code.
CNN_Network.py: contains the cnn network algorith and the training code.
Drawing_Classification_Demo.py: contains the code for the demo where you can draw your own images.
Digit_Data.py: contains data and dataloaders.
