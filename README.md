# B351-Final-Project
Handwriting recognition program using PyTorch

This is our Final project for Intro to AI. We will be using PyTorch to train 
our model, and compare algorithms.

To use the demo, make sure you have the require packages installed. THis includes tkinter, and pytorch modules. With these you will be able to run the demo that compares the two models.
